Movement data can (and is) collected in various ways, including GPS data from smartphones, GPS trackers, or other devices. Usually, we are interested in understanding the transportation mode of a user, as this can provide valuable insights into the user’s behavior and preferences. However, this information is usually not available, and it can be challenging to infer the transportation mode from the GPS data alone.\nIn this project, we will use anotated movement data from the project by Zheng et al. (2011). The goal is to enrich the data with additional features and build a model that can predict the transportation mode of a user based on the GPS data.\n\n\n\n\nZheng, Yu, Hao Fu, Xing Xie, Wei-Ying Ma, and Quannan Li. 2011.

    "text": "2.1 Original Dataset\nThe original dataset provided by Zheng et al. (2011) was collected in the GeoLife project (Microsoft Research Asia) by 182 users in a period of over three years (from April 2007 to August 2012). A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. This dataset contains 17’621 trajectories with a total distance of about 1.2 million kilometers and a total duration of 48,000+ hours. These trajectories were recorded by different GPS loggers and GPS-phones, and have a variety of sampling rates. 91 percent of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 1~5 seconds or every 5~10 meters per point.\nThis dataset consists of a broad range of users’ outdoor movements, including not only life routines like go home and go to work but also some entertainments and sports activities, such as shopping, sightseeing, dining, hiking, and cycling. 73 users have labeled their trajectories with transportation mode, such as driving, taking a bus, riding a bike and walking.",

    "section": "3.3 Step 3: Feature engineering",
    "text": "3.3 Step 3: Feature engineering\nFeature engineering is a crucial step in preparing data for analysis and modeling. It involves creating new variables, or features, that capture important patterns or relationships in the data. Well-designed features can enhance the performance of machine learning models by making the relevant information more accessible.\nIn this task, we aim to enrich the GPS dataset with features derived from the spatial and temporal relationships between consecutive points within each trajectory. Specifically, we will compute metrics such as the distance between consecutive points (step length), the time difference between consecutive timestamps (time lag), and the average speed over these intervals. These features provide valuable insights into movement behavior and are essential for distinguishing between different transportation modes.\nBy engineering these features, we transform raw GPS data into a more informative format, setting the stage for building predictive models.\n\n3.3.0.1 Speed\n\nfull_dataset &lt;- full_dataset |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    steplength = as.numeric(st_distance(lead(geom), geom, by_element = TRUE)),\n    timelag = as.numeric(difftime(lead(datetime), datetime, units = \"secs\")),\n    speed = steplength / timelag,\n    .by = track_id\n  )\n\nTo understand the relationship between movement speed and transportation modes, we will summarize and visualize the dataset. By analyzing the average speeds for different modes of transportation, we can identify distinct patterns that might aid in differentiating between them.\nIn this step, we compute the mean speed for each combination of transportation mode and track, ensuring that missing values do not skew the results. Afterward, we reorder the transportation modes based on their average speeds, making the visualization more intuitive. Finally, we create a boxplot to display the speed distributions for each mode, highlighting the variability and central tendencies within the data.\nThis analysis provides a clear overview of how speed varies by transportation mode, offering valuable insights for feature interpretation and model development.\n\nfull_dataset |&gt; \n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    speed = mean(speed, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .by = c(mode, track_id)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    mode = fct_reorder(mode, speed)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(speed, mode, fill = mode)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Average speed per segment for different transportation modes.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that Figure 3.1 shows that the average speed per segment varies significantly between different transportation modes. This information can be used to distinguish between modes based on speed-related features on a per segment basis. However, this might not help to distinguish transport mode on a per point basis.\n\n\n3.3.0.2 Acceleration\nAcceleration, the rate of change in speed over time, is a valuable feature for understanding movement dynamics. Unlike speed, which provides information about the magnitude of motion, acceleration captures changes in motion - whether an object is speeding up, slowing down, or maintaining a constant velocity.\nThis feature is particularly useful for distinguishing transportation modes. For example, walking and cycling often exhibit more frequent changes in acceleration compared to driving or taking a bus, which tend to involve smoother transitions in speed. By incorporating acceleration into our analysis, we gain a deeper understanding of movement patterns and improve the ability to differentiate between modes of transportation.\n\nfull_dataset &lt;- full_dataset |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    acceleration = (lead(speed) - speed) / timelag,\n    .by = track_id\n  )\n\nLet’s have a look at the distribution of acceleration for different transportation modes on a per segment level.\n\nfull_dataset |&gt; \n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    acceleration = mean(acceleration, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .by = c(mode, track_id)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    mode = fct_reorder(mode, acceleration)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(acceleration, mode, fill = mode)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Average acceleration per segment for different transportation modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.0.3 Sinuosity\nSinuosity is a measure of the curvature of a path, and can be defined as the ratio between the actual traveled distance and the straight-line distance between the start and end points. A perfectly straight path has a sinuosity of 1, while more winding paths have higher sinuosity values.\nThis feature provides valuable insights into movement behavior, as different transportation modes often exhibit distinct patterns of sinuosity. For instance, walking and cycling paths may have higher sinuosity due to detours or obstacles, while driving or taking a train tends to follow straighter routes. By incorporating sinuosity into the analysis, we can enhance the ability to classify transportation modes based on their characteristic movement patterns.\nTo calculate sinuosity, we must first specify an observation window. In this case, we will consider the sinuosity over the next 5 points of each trajectory. This window size allows us to capture the curvature of the path while avoiding excessive noise from individual points. We will compute the straight-line distance between the current point and the point 5 steps ahead, as well as the total distance traveled over these 5 steps. The sinuosity is then calculated as the ratio between these two distances.\n\nfull_dataset &lt;- full_dataset |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    straight_dist5 = as.numeric(st_distance(lead(geom, 5), geom, by_element = TRUE)),\n    full_dist5 = rollsum(steplength, 5, fill = NA, align = \"left\", ),\n    sinuosity = full_dist5/straight_dist5,\n    .by = track_id\n  )\n\nHow does the average sinuosity differ between the different transportation modes?\n\nfull_dataset |&gt; \n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    sinuosity = mean(sinuosity, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .by = c(mode, track_id)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    mode = fct_reorder(mode, sinuosity)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_boxplot(aes(sinuosity, mode, fill = mode)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Average sinuosity per segment for different transportation modes.",

Model training involves using labeled data to teach an algorithm to associate input features - such as speed, acceleration, and sinuosity - with the corresponding transportation mode.\nTo simplify the task, we will train a model to predict the transportation mode on a per segment basis.
